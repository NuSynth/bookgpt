// into this:
Chapter number|Chapter Name|Narrative Structure|Part of Narrative Structure|Character List|Chapter Plot*

// NOTE: Assign one character at a time so that they can more reliably be 
//       assigned within the bounds of their existence within the story. 

/* This must happen after assigning the character lists to their chapters. */
/* A separate list will have an element per chapter just for the characters

1. Do not initially store the generated plots into their part of the chapter skeletons.
2. Store each sub-plot into a list object. // Pretty sure I did this already.

//NOTE: SUB-PLOTS ARE BRIEF
3. In another list for the same number of elements, 
   generate a three-act version of each sub-plot// Sub-plots only follow the three act structure.
   Generate these from showing the base sub-plot, and the list of chapters that show which 
   characters are in which chapters. Also show the main plot in case it adds context.

   //NOTE: THERE CAN BE MORE THAN ONE SUB-PLOT IN A CHAPTER, BUT NOT MORE THAN ONE ACT OF A 
           PARTICULAR SUB-PLOT.

    The format of an element of the list of sub-plots is this: (Sub-Plots will not cross books, at least not yet.)
    
    Sub-Plot Act 1|Chapter Number*Sub-Plot Act 2|Chapter Number*Sub-Plot Act 3|Chapter Number*

   Each part is separated by an asterisk within the element.
   The pipe symbol allows me to place the sub-plot into the chapter on the other side of the pipe.
   Plots must be breif because they are smaller than the main plots and are to simply be integrated
   into their corresponding main plots.
   The sub-plots serve to allow for more interconnections within the stories.

4. Generate breif plots for each chapter first, all at the same time so gpt can have a full view.
5. Present ChatGPT with the full list of chapters and the brief MAIN plots just generated that is stored
   within the plot variables. 
   
   Generate 1 long version of the breif plot at a time for each chapter, and integrate the corresponding sub-plots.


   



// I dont need to use chatGPT for the formatting.
// Build a skelleton myself using {num_books} and {num_chapters}

// Each book is an element of a list.
// Each element uses the * symbol to separate the chapters from eachother 
// so they can be added to a list later.
// Each chapter uses the | symbol









I just used that other stories chapter template as an example. I need you to put 
what ever the actual narrative structure is in place of \"The Thee-Act Structure\" 
within the brackets. 

I need you to put what ever part of the narrative structure you assign the 
chapter in place of \"Act 1\" within the brackets. 
I also need you to use the actual name of the chapter from the list in place of 
\"Echoes of Tomorrow. Do not output anything other than this new list in the 
format I specified or you will break my computer."

"ONLY LIST THE STUFF I TOLD YOU IN THE WAY I TOLD YOU TO LIST IT BECAUSE 
SOFTWARE RECIEVES YOUR OUTPUT, AND IF YOU ADD EVEN A LITTE COMMENTARY, 
OR IF YOU DO NOT PUT THE PARTS INSIDE OF THE BRACKETS LIKE I SPECIFIED, 
OR IF YOU DO NOT PUT THE CORRECT NARRATIVE STRUCTURE IN THE BRACKETS, 
AND IF YOU DONT ASSIGN PART OF THE NARRATIVE STRUCTURE TO THE CHAPTER
AND DO NOT PUT IT IN THE BRACKETS AS SPECIFIED, THEN YOU WILL BREAK MY FUCKING
COMPUTER!!!

INCLUDE THE * AS SHOWN BECAUSE THE SOFTWARE THAT RECIEVES YOUR OUTPUT 
NEEDS IT, AND IF IT DOES NOT GET IT, THEN YOU WILL BREAK MY FUCKING COMPUTER!!!!

THE ONLY EXCEPTION IS THE LAST CHAPTER BECAUSE PUTTING A * 
AFTER THAT WILL BREAK MY FUCKING COMPUTER!!!!!!!!!!"
