[The Three-Act Structure] // This is for chatGPT to see that the book follows the three-act structure
[Act 1] // This part is for chatGPT to know which part of the narrative structure of the book that the chapter is being designed for. 
[new characters list] // list characters that are being introduced into the story
[character list] // list the rest of the characters who appear in this chapter
[death list] // list characters who die in this chapter
[Plot] // This contains the plot of the story



*Note: If a character appears in a later chapter than when it died, have the AI use the character either as a memory,
a spirit, a conversation piece. The character can not just reappear after dying.
