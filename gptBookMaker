GUI Parts:

*Note: Files of authors for these two components are stored in two directories 
       made just for these options. The files have serial numbers as the file 
       names. The files contain either just the author name, or the attribute 
       of the author, for writing style, and story design style.
       
Writing Style:
        This is a dropdown menu with different author names for the style of writing.
        These use a file that either has the authors name, or style attributes of the
        author if the bot will not mimmick the style using the authors name.

Story Structure Style:
        This is like the writing style dropdown menu. The style attributes stored in 
        the file for authors, if the bot will not use the name of the real author, 
        relates to the structure and idea style of their stories themselves, not the
        writing or wording styles.
        
        This one is more complicated than writing style. This might also include
        writing style for chapter and section titles. Not sure yet. But it has more to
        do with narrative templates the author might use (The Three-Act Structure,
        The Hero's Journey, Fichtean Curve, etc.)
        
        One idea is to allow a different author design all the parts of the book,
        and using the author's narrative style. The author here makes the plot,
        plans out the chapters, characters, events, everything except write the 
        actual story. This author writes a summary for each chapter, which the 
        writer author will expand upon and re-write in their own style.
        

Note: The narrative templates need to be pre-built into my program to use as 
      templates for the program and AI to use.



Series: True/False and Number of books
        This is to let the AI know if the story is a series, or a single book.
        If it is a series, then the program needs to know how many books to
        make the series. Right now, the series must be limited for how i'm 
        designing the system. An ongoing or never ending series needs some other 
        systems, though it might be simpler.
        
        
        

Story building parts:


Before story writing author writes story:
*NOTE: the order in which to fill these parts out (story plots, chapters, characters)
       should probably be experimented with for best results.

it will generate:

Names of the books or book

Names of the characters
Possibly a short back story for each character. (Might be done after plots are all designed.)

*NOTE: Template is already selected so the chapter numbers will be applied
       to their respective sections within the template
number of chapters for each book (a number with a blank next to it in the file.)
names of each chapter (Filled into the numbers, and cross checked for repeats.)



Plots
Main plot of book or series
Book plots
Sub-plots



*Note: 400 pages has between 40 to 80 chapters.
