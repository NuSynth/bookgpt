# bookgpt
This program writes entire novels.

# Quality of the novels can vary.
It writes good young adult fiction. I havent tested it with more complicated fiction for something comparable to DUNE. All chapters need to be reviewed and edited for consistency.

# AUTHOR SYSTEM
If you run the program, you will notice that users can select the story to be designed in the style of one author, while having it write in the style of another. This is to reduce the risk that it will plagiarize a particular author. It's possible that it will design a story pretty closely to a story designed by the author selected for the style of the design, but if a different author is selected for the style of the writing then I think the risk of plagiarization is pretty low. Plus, I have the story idea box, which allows users to provide an idea for the story of their own, which even further decreases the chance of the artificial intelligence performing plagiarization. So that's what those things are about. Hopefully the works that get produced are as original as can be.

# WARNING ON TOKENS
Using this program costs tokens from OpenAI and Google Gemini, if the checkbox is not checked for "Only a template."

# WARNING ON BOOK QUALITY
The current quality of the books is ok for young adults. I have not yet tested it for anything more complicated.
