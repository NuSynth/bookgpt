# bookgpt
This program is intended to guide ChatGPT through prompts to make it write entire novels and series of novels.


This program is not yet complete. There are a couple of sections left to write. I actually got sick of working on it, because I dont even like the program. But it will be able to generate a ton of books within a few minutes, and has the capability to make the user a lot of money by selling the novels on Amazon, without the user doing any more work other than uploading the books to Amazon.
